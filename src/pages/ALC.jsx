          <strong>Less than 5% of B.C.'s land</strong> is suitable for farming.
          The Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) of British Columbia manages
          land use across the provinceâ€™s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR),
          safeguarding these areas from urban development and other
          non-agricultural uses.

        <p className="mt-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Through the ALC portal, landowners submit applications for things like
          subdividing farmland, building homes, or requesting non-farm uses.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          These applications are reviewed by staff using an internal system to
          ensure agricultural land is protected and used responsibly. Because
          these decisions directly affect food security, land development, and
          environmental policy, the system plays a critical role in balancing
          public and private interests.
